# Discord News
An application that is designed to pull news from newspapers, blogs etc. The intention for this project is to provide a way to publish news articles related to tech in Discord channels, through [Discord's webhooks][discord-webhooks-intro].

This project is written in [Kotlin][kotlinlang]. I've also decided to use [Spring][spring] because I'm familiar with their dependency injection, and they provide some useful features to run HTTP requests etc.
